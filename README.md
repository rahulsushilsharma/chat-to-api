# Welcome to Chat to Api

This project is basicly to convert the open LLM chats that are publicly avilabe to a Api like interface such that they are easily automatable to test different LLMs capablities. 

# Usage

The usage is simple what you need to do is clone the project through
```
git clone https://github.com/rahulsushilsharma/chat-to-api.git
``` 
## Config


move to the created chat-to-api folder and install and run the main script
```
cd chat-to-api
npm install
npm run start
``` 
the aboue command will open a chrome window and will go to the chatgpt and will run a server through which you can connect and use the LLM's capablities.
> Note: Don't minimise the chrome tab just open your application on top of it as it will be detected as a bot.
